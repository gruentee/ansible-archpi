# ansible-archpi

## :warning: rough draft ⚠️:warning:

[Ansible](https://ansible.com) sample project with role for doing initial setup work as described in ArchLinuxARM's and ArchLinux Wiki, only tested with RaspberryPi 2 for now.

Role folder structure was „cut out“ using the awesome [cookiecutter-ansible-role](https://github.com/ferrarimarco/cookiecutter-ansible-role).
